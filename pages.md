## Executive Summary

### Current State
EBSCOed has strong foundational content on core solution pages (Talent Marketplace, ETPL Management, Case Management) but several critical gaps exist:

- **Placeholder pages** requiring immediate content: Partners, Privacy Policy, Get Connected, Contribute, Our Commitments, Security White Paper
- **Thin content** needing expansion: Who We Are overview, Solutions overview, Leadership
- **Missing differentiation content**: No explicit competitor positioning, limited proof points, incomplete case study data

### Priority Tiers (Based on Footer Navigation Structure)

|------|-------|----------|
| **1** | Home, Solutions (all), Who We Are (all) | Critical |
| **2** | Partners, Get Connected, Articles | High |
